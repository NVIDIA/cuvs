# Lucene Backend

The optional `lucene` backend runs cuVS Bench against a local Lucene index. It
embeds the JVM through PyLucene. The CPU HNSW control uses stock Lucene through
PyLucene. The cuVS-Lucene thin JAR supplies GPU CAGRA search and GPU-accelerated
HNSW construction with CPU HNSW search. PyLucene is an implementation detail;
the public cuVS Bench backend name is `lucene`.

Selecting this backend is explicit. Commands that do not select it with
`--backend lucene` continue to use the `cpp_gbench` backend and its existing
`cuvs_cagra` default.

## Algorithms

| Algorithm | Codec | Build and search path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lucene_cuvs_cagra` | `CuVS2510GPUSearchCodec` | cuVS CAGRA on a supported NVIDIA GPU |
| `lucene_accelerated_hnsw` | `Lucene101AcceleratedHNSWCodec` | cuVS CAGRA build with Lucene CPU HNSW search; CPU HNSW build fallback when GPU support is unavailable |
| `lucene_cpu_hnsw` | `Lucene101` | Lucene CPU HNSW control |

`lucene_cuvs_cagra` is selected when `--backend lucene` is used without an
explicit `--algorithms` value. Select `lucene_cpu_hnsw` explicitly when a CPU
control is needed.

```bash
python -m cuvs_bench.run \
    --backend lucene \
    --dataset test-data \
    --dataset-path /absolute/path/to/datasets \
    --algorithms lucene_cuvs_cagra \
    --groups test \
    --batch-size 10 \
    -k 10 \
    --build --search
```

## Runtime requirements

The Lucene backend is opt-in because its runtime is not provisioned by the
ordinary cuVS Bench installation. Provisioning the required custom PyLucene
build is currently external to cuVS Bench. Every algorithm requires PyLucene
10.2.0 and JDK 22. Both cuVS-backed algorithms require matching `cuvs-java`
and thin `cuvs-lucene` JARs. GPU execution additionally requires compatible
native cuVS, CUDA, and a supported NVIDIA GPU. `lucene_cuvs_cagra` fails when
that GPU path is unavailable. `lucene_accelerated_hnsw` instead retains the
codec's intentional CPU-writer fallback.
The backend discovers artifacts built by the current checkout or installed in
the local Maven repository. For nonstandard locations, set both
`CUVS_LUCENE_CUVS_JAVA_JAR` and `CUVS_LUCENE_JAR`; use `JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH` for
native libraries. An explicit native-library path must contain an unversioned
`libcuvs_c.so`.

Do not use the cuVS-Lucene JAR assembled with dependencies: PyLucene already
provides Lucene classes, and loading a second copy can make the embedded JVM
classpath inconsistent.

The initial backend accepts nonempty, finite, `float32` Euclidean/L2 vectors
and supports latency-mode sweeps. The CPU HNSW algorithm accepts at most 1024
dimensions; both cuVS-backed algorithms accept at most 4096. CAGRA uses the
codec's fixed defaults and supports `k <= 1024`. The backend validates the
physical segment codec and every persisted vector field before searching, and
fails if CAGRA construction silently produced a brute-force index. Both HNSW
algorithms support an explicit `num_candidates` value greater than or equal to
`k`; their CPU search path is not subject to CAGRA's `k <= 1024` limit.

## Timing contract

This initial backend invokes one Lucene query at a time. The common cuVS Bench
`--batch-size` value is retained for configuration and result-file
compatibility, but it does not introduce bulk or concurrent execution. Results
therefore record both `requested_batch_size` and
`effective_search_batch_size=1` and use one latency sample per query.

The headline latency is the complete `client_query` boundary: Java vector and
query preparation, the synchronous search call, and hit materialization. QPS
uses the wall time for the entire serial query corpus, so it is not simply the
reciprocal of mean latency. The raw result also reports narrower preparation,
PyLucene search-dispatch, result-materialization, reader lifecycle, and NumPy
conversion timings. `search_dispatch_kind` distinguishes direct PyLucene
dispatch from the thin-JAR timing bridge. Compare timing results only when that
value matches. Selecting the CPU and GPU algorithms together loads the bridge
for both and provides a like-for-like dispatch-boundary comparison; the
artifact-free CPU control remains useful but is not dispatch-identical.

When the backend initializes from a validated cuvs-java and cuvs-lucene
artifact pair, an additional `java_index_searcher_search` measurement uses
`System.nanoTime()` around exactly `IndexSearcher.search(Query, int)` inside
the JVM. This exact Java measurement is diagnostic and is unavailable to the
artifact-free CPU control. The reported timing boundaries are nested rather
than additive; summing parent and child values double-counts work.

`backend_search_invocation_total_ms` measures one complete non-dry-run search
invocation after argument validation and dry-run handling. A parameter sweep
copies that one shared invocation value into every plan row; do not interpret
or sum it as a per-plan duration.

Before each search-parameter plan, the backend sequentially reads every regular
index file to establish the same host page-cache policy for CPU and GPU paths.
It runs no discarded warmup queries: the first query remains part of the
result, and first-query and subsequent-query values are reported separately
for the client-query and PyLucene-dispatch boundaries, plus the exact JVM
search boundary when Java timing is available. That contrast can reveal
first-query effects, but it does not establish steady state or isolate every
JVM, CUDA, or cuVS initialization cost. Build results similarly separate
dataset preparation, runtime setup, writer lifecycle, index validation,
publication, and total backend time.

## Integration tests

Run the live CPU/GPU suite from the repository root after providing the same
runtime prerequisites:

```bash
python -m pytest -q -s \
    python/cuvs_bench/cuvs_bench/tests/test_lucene_integration.py \
    --run-lucene-e2e
```

Without `--run-lucene-e2e`, ordinary cuVS Bench test runs skip these live
cases. Once selected, every case requires PyLucene and Java. GPU-intended cases
also require the cuVS Java artifacts, native libraries, CUDA, and a supported
GPU; missing prerequisites fail rather than skip. Accelerated-HNSW GPU-intended
cases fail if the codec logs its CPU-writer fallback. A separate GPU-hidden
negative control verifies that this warning remains observable and attributable
to the case that produced it.
